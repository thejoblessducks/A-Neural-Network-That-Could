# A-Neural-Network-That-Could

This program implements a double layer MLP with backpropagation training Neural Network in python, for a next version we could allow the creation of more hidden layers. This program does not use ML libraries such as TensorFlow or Keras.

The program will provide you with "mugshots" of the neural network in the ./Images file, it will also, if you choose, present you the gragh between the epochs,learning rates and median errors, just remmenber that the more epochs you alloew the net the slower thee gragh will become.

During the .Version1/Main.py execution you will have to provide the input dataset/file in ./Version1/Data as well as the testing file also in the same directory.
